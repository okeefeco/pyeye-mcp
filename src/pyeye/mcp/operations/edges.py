"""Edge-status registry and structural edge resolvers for ``expand``.

This module is the **single source of truth** for which traversal edges
``expand`` supports.  It provides two distinct lookups:

1. :func:`edge_status` — classify any edge name into exactly one of four
   machine-distinguishable statuses.  The status string IS the ``reason``
   string ``expand`` emits for unsupported edges.
2. :data:`EDGE_RESOLVERS` / the resolver registry — maps *implemented* edge
   names (``members``, ``callees``, ``imported_by``, ``subclasses``,
   ``superclasses``, ``imports``, ``enclosing_scope``, ``submodules``) to their
   resolver callables.  ``members``/``callees``/``superclasses``/``imports``/
   ``enclosing_scope``/``submodules`` are synchronous and always return an
   :class:`EdgeResult` or ``None``; ``imported_by`` and ``subclasses`` are
   **async**.  ``imported_by`` and ``imports`` return ``EdgeResult | None``
   — ``None`` is their wrong-kind signal (the handle is not a module).
   ``subclasses``, ``superclasses``, and ``enclosing_scope`` ALWAYS return an
   :class:`EdgeResult` (never ``None``): a module handle yields
   ``EdgeResult([])`` for ``enclosing_scope`` because modules have no lexical
   enclosing scope; non-class handles yield ``EdgeResult([])`` for
   ``subclasses``/``superclasses``.  An :class:`EdgeResult` carries the
   adjacent canonical handles plus, for ``callees`` only, the count of
   unresolved call sites.  ``expand`` awaits any awaitable resolver result.

Architectural constraint
-------------------------
This module MUST NOT import from ``inspect.py``.  ``inspect`` imports
:func:`resolve_members` to derive ``edge_counts.members`` (landed in Phase 5)
and :func:`resolve_superclasses` to derive ``edge_counts.superclasses``
(landed in Phase 6 / #361) — importing back from ``inspect`` here would
create a circular import.  ``resolve_members`` and ``resolve_superclasses``
are therefore the **sole** enumeration sources for their respective edges.

The ``members`` resolver is pure structural enumeration — it never calls
``get_references`` / ``find_references``.  The module path uses Jedi
``get_names(all_scopes=False)`` to enumerate top-level definitions, then
subtracts import-bound names from the AST — guaranteeing the only divergence
from the legacy count is import exclusion (spec §3.3).

    Carries the adjacent ``(canonical handle, Jedi Name)`` pairs, plus — for
    ``callees`` only — the count of call sites that could not be statically
    resolved.  The Jedi ``Name`` is retained per adjacent so ``expand`` can
    build a stub WITHOUT re-resolving the handle (re-resolution is wasteful and
    unreliable for builtins such as ``builtins.float``).  The resolvers already
    hold the exact ``Name`` at the point they construct each ``Handle``, so they
    pass it through here.

            resolved — rendered as their intended dotted path (e.g.
            ``"pkg.mod.name"``, ``".sibling.thing"`` for a relative import).

      filtered by ``full_name`` prefix + exact depth.

    The outbound-but-reliably-static ``subclasses`` edge for a **class** handle.
    Reuses :meth:`JediAnalyzer.find_subclasses` — an AST class-graph walk +
    forward ``goto``/``resolve_canonical`` (NO ``get_references`` /
    ``find_references``, the same load-bearing trust constraint as ``callees`` /
    ``imported_by``).  ``subclasses`` is an **expand-only** edge: ``inspect``
    does NOT measure it (dropped in #392; a cheap direct count is gated on the
    Pyright reference backend / class-graph cache — #333/#397 — because even the
    DIRECT count needs the same project-wide scan, exactly like ``callers`` /
    ``references``).

    Single-hop semantics (#422): ``expand`` walks ONE edge to the IMMEDIATE
    neighbours, so this resolver returns the **DIRECT** subclasses only (depth 1,
    ``include_indirect=False``) — symmetric with ``superclasses`` (direct bases).
    The full transitive closure is served exclusively by
    ``trace(follow=["subclasses"], max_depth=k, max_nodes=N)``, which already owns
    the cap + ``truncated`` contract; ``expand`` carries a static pointer to that
    route.  (Before #422 this returned the full direct+indirect closure, which
    overflowed the MCP token cap on widely-subclassed bases and collapsed trace's
    per-hop BFS onto depth 1.)

    Static-surface ceiling: the result is "complete" only over literal
    ``class B(A):`` subclassing.  Dynamically-created subclasses
    (``type('B', (A,), {})``, factory-built classes, ``__init_subclass__``
    registration) are NOT captured — the same static-only boundary
    ``resolve_imported_by`` carries for dynamic imports.  ``[]`` therefore means
    "no statically-declared direct subclasses," not "no subclasses at runtime."

    Each adjacent's ``Name`` is a :class:`ClassSentinel` built DIRECTLY from the
    AST facts ``find_subclasses`` already returns (``full_name`` + file + line
    span) — never by re-deriving a Jedi ``Name`` (#445).  The old re-derivation
    matched on Jedi's ``full_name``, which is warm-inference-state-dependent
    (jedi #1796), and SILENTLY DROPPED any subclass it could not rebuild — under
    cache thrash that lost ~half the results, non-deterministically across
    result-cache rebuilds, re-importing the very non-determinism #419 removed at
    the ``find_subclasses`` layer.  The sentinel needs no Jedi (so it never
    drops and is path-independent — #335 macOS-symlink robustness preserved) and
    round-trips as a resolver input for multi-hop
    ``trace(follow=["subclasses"])``.  A subclass stub is a pointer
    (handle + location + kind); the constructor signature is an ``inspect``
    detail, not a one-hop ``expand`` field — symmetric with ``imported_by``'s
    ``ModuleSentinel`` stubs.

    Kind gate (the slice's defining decision):

    - **class** → measured: ``EdgeResult`` with the subclass handles (possibly
      empty if the class has no project subclasses — a genuine measured "none").
    - **non-class** (function / variable / module / …) → ``EdgeResult([])``,

      kind is true by definition (exactly the ``members``/``callees`` case) —
      NOT the absence-vs-zero lie that forces ``imported_by``'s ``None`` path.

def resolve_superclasses(jedi_name: Any, analyzer: JediAnalyzer) -> EdgeResult:
    """Return the DIRECT superclasses of a class as canonical handles.

    The inbound-but-reliably-static ``superclasses`` edge for a **class**
    handle.  Returns only DIRECT bases (no MRO closure), mirroring the count
    in ``inspect.edge_counts.superclasses``.  Symmetric with ``subclasses``,
    which also returns DIRECT children only since #422 (expand = one hop in
    both inheritance directions; the closure is served by ``trace``).

    Mechanics:

    1. Walk the class's cached AST to locate its ``ClassDef.bases`` — the
       declared direct bases (source order).
    2. For each base expression, call ``script.goto(line, col,
       follow_imports=True)`` with the position from
       :func:`attr_target_position`, preferring ``class``-kind results, so
       ``pkg.sub.ClassName`` resolves to the class, not the package.
    3. Keep the first goto def that has a ``full_name`` and builds a valid
       :class:`Handle`.  The goto ``Name`` is carried directly as the
       adjacent's ``Name`` (no re-resolution).
    4. Dedup by canonical handle string; sort by handle string for
       deterministic order (like ``resolve_subclasses``).
    5. Bases that produce no goto result with a ``full_name`` are DROPPED
       (can't build a valid stub without a ``Name``).  This is intentional —
       the count derives from this resolver (see ``inspect._count_superclasses``)
       so ``len(stubs) == inspect.edge_counts.superclasses`` is guaranteed by
       construction.

    Kind gate (the defining decision of this edge):

    - **class** → measured: ``EdgeResult`` with the direct-base handles
      (possibly empty if the class has no explicit bases — a genuine measured
      "none").
    - **non-class** (function / variable / module / …) → ``EdgeResult([])``,
      NEVER ``None``.  Only a class CAN have superclasses, so ``[]`` for the
      wrong kind is true by definition (exactly the ``members``/``callees``
      case) — NOT the absence-vs-zero lie that forces ``imported_by``'s
      ``None`` path.  Because this resolver never returns ``None``,
      ``expand.py`` needs no change.

    Synchronous: AST walk + per-base Jedi ``goto`` + ``Handle`` construction
    are all sync, like ``resolve_members``/``resolve_callees``.  No
    ``get_references`` / ``find_references`` is ever called.

    Args:
        jedi_name: Resolved Jedi ``Name`` for the target.  Class-ness is

      the wildcard; mirrors ``_module_members``'s wildcard gap).

    Unresolvable imports (goto yields no def / no ``full_name`` / ``Handle``
    construction failure) cannot become adjacents — no Name to build a stub — but
    are NOT silently dropped (#494): their statically-derived intended dotted
    target (e.g. ``"pkg.mod.name"``) is collected into ``unresolved_imports``, so
    a missed dependency is surfaced rather than read as absent.  ``from X import
    *`` remains skipped (wildcard targets cannot be enumerated statically) and is
    not counted as unresolved.

    Dedup by canonical handle string; deterministic order (sorted by handle
    string, mirroring ``resolve_subclasses``/``resolve_superclasses``).

    Synchronous: cached AST walk + per-import Jedi ``goto`` + ``Handle``
    construction are all sync.  No ``get_references``/``find_references`` is
    ever called.

    This is the base case the ``submodules`` enumerator (Task 3) builds on: a
    package handle is resolved to the directory (or directories) whose children
    are its candidate submodules / subpackages.

    The regular-vs-namespace decision is made **once**, here, by inspecting the
    resolved handle's ``module_path``:

    - ends in ``__init__.py`` → **regular package** → return the SINGLE parent
      directory of that ``__init__.py`` (a regular package has exactly one
      on-disk directory).
    - a ``.py`` ``module_path`` that is not ``__init__.py`` → a plain module or
      a class/function handle (defined in some ``X.py``) → NOT a package → ``[]``.
    - otherwise (``None`` or a directory ``module_path``) → the **namespace
      branch**.  A PEP 420 namespace package has no ``__init__.py`` and may be
      spread across several portions; its directory(ies) are found by matching
      the dotted ``full_name`` under each sys.path root, delegated to
      :func:`pyeye.canonicalization.find_namespace_package_dirs` (#444).

    The namespace branch returns the **union** of the matching portion
    directories in ``roots`` (sys.path precedence) order — a regular package
    portion (one carrying ``__init__.py``) is excluded, and the order is what
    :func:`_enumerate_submodule_paths` rides on for first-portion-wins collision
    determinism (#419 class).

    A ``None``/empty ``full_name`` (e.g. a builtin or unresolved handle with no
    matching root dir) yields ``[]``.

    Args:

    :class:`_SubmoduleEntry` tuples, derived ENTIRELY from ``iterdir`` metadata —
    NO file is read (so a later task can ``len()`` this list as a cheap count).

    The package-vs-non-package decision and the directory resolution are both
    delegated to :func:`_package_dirs` (no duplication): a non-package handle
    (plain module, class/function, ``None``) yields ``[]`` because
    ``_package_dirs`` yields ``[]``.  The enumerator loops over EVERY directory
    ``_package_dirs`` returns; for Task 3 that is at most one (the regular case),
    but iterating already prepares for Task 4's multi-portion namespace union
    (which extends ``_package_dirs`` + adds cross-directory dedup, not this body).

    Per directory, scanning DIRECT entries only (one ``iterdir``), with
    ``__pycache__`` and dot-names always skipped:

      namespace subpackage, ``file = X/`` (the directory itself),

    The parent handle for building child handles is the resolved name's
